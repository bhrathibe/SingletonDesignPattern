README: Singleton Design Pattern in C#
----------------------------------------------

### Context:

This C# program demonstrates the implementation of the Singleton design pattern for logging messages to a file. 
The program provides an interactive console interface where the user can enter messages to be logged.


### Singleton Design Pattern:

The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it throughout the application's lifetime. 
In this program, the `SingletonClass` is responsible for logging messages to a file.


### Why Singleton in .NET Application:

In .NET applications, Singleton is used when you want to ensure that there's only one instance of a class across the entire application. 
This can be crucial in scenarios where sharing a single instance is important, such as managing a central resource like a log file.

### Benefits of Singleton:

1. **Global Access**: Provides a global point of access to the instance, making it easy to manage shared resources.
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Ensures that only one instance is created, reducing memory consumption.
3. **Thread Safety**: Handles multithreading scenarios by providing a synchronized access point.

### Ancient Way to Read File (Without Singleton):

Before the introduction of modern constructs like `using`, files were managed by explicitly opening, reading, and closing them. 
This involved creating objects like `FileStream` and `StreamWriter` to handle file operations.

### When to Use Singleton:

Singleton is useful when you need a single, shared instance of a class. 
This is applicable in scenarios like managing configuration settings, logging, database connections, thread pools, and more.
